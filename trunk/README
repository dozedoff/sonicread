SonicRead helps you to to extract data from your Polar heart rate monitor using Soniclink.
Follow the below stated steps to do so.

* Make sure you are in a quiet environment to prevent glitches in the audio signal. 
* Enable the microphone signal in the Volume Control program of your Operating System.
* Press the Start button in SonicRead.
* Hold your watch near the microphone. 
* Select "Connect" in the menu of your Polar. 
* SonicRead should indicate that it started processing SonicLink data, and will update 
  the progress bar.
* When done, press the Save button and save the hsr file to the location you wish
* Use SportsTracker (http://www.saring.de/sportstracker/index.html) to view the data.

If SonicRead doesn't recognize the signal, check the microphone volume:
  The dB meter bar should be around 20-30% full when picking up background noise.
  If you make noise, like for example snapping your finger, the progress bar 
  indicator should rise to 80-90%, and will possible indicate that the audio signal 
  clipped.
