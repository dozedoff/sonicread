SonicRead is a java program tries to read the acoustic data sent by a Polar 
S410, S510 or a S520 heart rate monitor. Currently SonicRead spits out raw data.
You will need 'createhrm' to convert this output to hrm data which can be used
in for example SportsTracker[1].

Thanks to Tom√°s Oliveira e Silva[2] for his time spent on decoding the 
Soniclink waveform and the structure of the data. See his website 
for the original code [3].

This program should run on any platform supported by Java, but I only tested it
on Linux (Ubuntu 8.04/8.10). Createhrm is written in C. I'm trying to convert
this to java too.

Execute `make run` to start SonicRead

Please be gentle on my code; its my first Java program :X
