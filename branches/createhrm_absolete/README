CreateHRM

The goal of this project is to extract sport data from a Polar heart rate 
monitor under the Linux operating system.

CreateHRM converts the raw Polar Soniclink data into the Polar-format; hrm. 
This format can be read by several programs. To extract the Soniclink data 
from the Polar you can use the java program SonicRead. To analyse the hrm 
data, Sportstracker[1] can be used.

Since I personally own a Polar S510 with the Soniclink (Acoustic) connection, 
this program currently only supports this type of Polar monitor. 

I've tested this program intensivily by converting exercises with and without
bike (speed) data, with and without intervals and by using the lap-counter of 
Polar. I could have missed, of mis-interpretate some bits and bytes tho, so 
please contact me if you see complete bogus converted data.

Example of how to use the functionallity of CreateHRM
> java SonicRead 
paste output in 'yymmdd01.srd'
> createhrm -i data.srd > yymmdd01.hrm
open yymmdd01.hrm in PolarViewer

I hope you enjoy using this program
